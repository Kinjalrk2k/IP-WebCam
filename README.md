# IP-WebCam
A Python script to exploit various features of the IP Webcam android app. Using the app and it's web interface to interact with ```Python``` and ```OpenCV```. This is an attempt to easen Pythonic development using Android Camera. Android Camera can be used as altrernatives for various OpenCV and Rasphberry Pi projects.

### The Android App
- Find the regular version [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en)
- The pro version [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam.pro&hl=en)

> Original credits for the Android app goes to [*Pavel Khlebovich*](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Pavel+Khlebovich). I'm just using the app for my personal development.

### Few routes
- Current sensor values - ```/status.json```
- List of available sensors and modes - ```/status.json?show_avail=1```

### A far-fetched Plan
- A GUI to use the features at the client end
- A Cross platform app, that serves as a an camera server
- Specialized cameras loaded with sensors which utilizes this project

### Important
*This project is in it's development phase. Parts of the main idea may not be implemented yet. Do check the [Projects Tab - Features](https://github.com/Kinjalrk2k/IP-WebCam/projects/1) for details.*

### Notes
This project was created and tested under Windows, and is expected to work fully in other systems too.

This project is still under development. Parts of the source codes may not be well documented.
Also suitable prompts may not be available for the user at the moment.

More features and fixes are yet to come. Meanwhile suggestions, ideas, bug reports are welcomed.

I am a python n00bie! I am still learning python! I have tried my best to give in as much effort required (of course directly proportionate to my knowledge), for this project.
